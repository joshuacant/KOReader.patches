# KOReader.patches

This is where I put assorted user patches I have made for KOReader. 

Support here is much more limited compared to Project: Title, but feel free to open an issue if you encounter a bug. 
But to keep expectations in check: I may not fix it, if it doesn't impact how I use the patch.

Please do not submit any feature requests. I made these to do what I wanted them to, sometimes adding in a little 
extra when it's not too much work or I found it interesting. Rather, feel free to expand on them however you like, 
and remember to share with me any neat stuff you add.
