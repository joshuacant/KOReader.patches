# KOReader.patches

This is where I put assorted user patches I have made for KOReader. 

Support here is much more limited compared to Project: Title, but feel free to open an issue if you encounter a bug. 
But to keep expectations in check: I may not fix it, if it doesn't impact how I use the patch.

Please do not submit any feature requests. I made these to do what I wanted them to, sometimes adding in a little 
extra when it's not too much work or I found it interesting. Rather, feel free to expand on them however you like, 
and remember to share with me any neat stuff you add.

Links below with brief descriptions. Longer descriptions and instructions can (sometimes) be found at the top of the
user patch file itself.
